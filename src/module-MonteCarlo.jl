# This code/module has been written without any tests so far; apart from syntax errors, a number of
# logical errors need to be expected. Nonetheless, it provides a rather complete set of functions in order 
# collect useful histograms of different kind and resolution from the stepwise cascade decay of atoms 
# and ions. Not all the functions have been realized in full details yet.

# At present, this module is not (yet) included into the JAC code.
# It might be useful to think about useful termination conditions for cases, in which the full tree
# need not to be analyzed for each individual shot. These conditions need to be formulated with proper care.


"""
`module  JAC.MonteCarlo`  
    ... a submodel of JAC that contains all methods for dealing with the (Monte-Carlo) simulations of coincidence
    spectra and maps. This module is based on (the definition of) a large set of MonteCarlos.Level's and the 
    idea of Monte-Carlo shots, which follow the probabilities to come along different charge states and atomic
    levels. The coincidence maps are then obtained by following a great numbers of shots in order to construct the 
    requested n-dimensional histograms. Each shot gives rise to one or several (particle) events, i.e. the emission
    of electrons, photons, etc. with certain energies (properties). In fact, this Monte-Carlo approach appears as
    the method of choice to extract useful one- and multi-dimensional histograms (abundance maps of coincidence
    events).
    
    This module provides a rather general machinery to extract different cuts (maps) through coincidence data.
    It enables one to extract such one- or multi-dimensional maps from cascade simultations with little adaption
    of input and specialized functions. Here, functions are provided to make single Monte-Carlo shots through a 
    tree (list) of MonteCarlo.Level's, by starting from a pre-set of such levels. Other functions enable the user 
    to initalize a histogram of given kind or to fill such histograms by analyzing the evens from single shots.
    
    A Monte-Carlo tree follows the idea of well-defined parent-daughter relations: Each parent level has none, 
    one or several daugthers, i.e. subsequent levels to which it can decay. A Monte-Carlo shop ends, if no 
    daughter occurs, or ti proceeds to one of the daughters due to some given probabilities. While each level
    can act as parent, its parents themselve remain largely unknown and do not affect the subsequent steps.
    
    All levels are based  on the charge state, energy, parity, and total J of levels, a total decay rate as well 
    as a number of daughter levels, which are encoded by their level index, the emitted particle type and the 
    accumulated probability, i.e. the sum of all probabilities, including those for the current daughter in the list. 
    This encoding with accumulated probabilities simplifies the use of individual shots as well as the extraction 
    of useful events.

        momentum, parity and rate of the level is often obsolete to follow individual shots through the cascade tree 
        but have been introduced to identify the physical origin of the level.
        
        An accumulated probability can be assigned to each level, if appropriate and if a list of such levels
